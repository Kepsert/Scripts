# Scripts
These are some scripts I've written during game jams, some excerpts. The cutscene controller is easy to expand and allows for you to control player/AI characters and have them perform specific actions in order to create cutscenes.
The PlayerController uses a basis by Tarodev but has expanded this. Using unity atoms.
The Objectpoolmanager is a script that uses scriptable objects, ObjectEffect, so save/keep used effects such as hand-drawn particles.
The audio part is used to control the volume and play/change music/SFX whenever needed.
